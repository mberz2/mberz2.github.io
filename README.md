### Introduction

Welcome!

This repository/page serves a professional website and resume. Primarily this site will feature a variety of work and information related to the past few years of my studies at Portland State University majoring in Computer Science.

The site is built using HTML and CSS with limited Bootstrap Framework (for grids + flexboxes). Animationes are scripted using a combinatio nof JavaScript and Jquery.

Below you will find a rough outline of what sections I will complete, as well as some meaningful updates.

### Updates

- 8/16/2021 - Site deployed.

- 8/16/2021 - Used online guide: https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/blog/responsive-navbar-without-bootstrap/ for basis of a Fixed Navbar without Bootstrap.

- 8/17/2021 - Working on style/look/feel. Going with a single page design to be able to focus more on interactive elements, clean presentation, and JavaScript. Going with a retro-coder look (monospaced fonts, simple icons, etc).

- 8/18/2021 - Site setup mostly complete. Added first major interactive component outside the navbar, which consists of modal boxes that display information related to the resume. Going to work on code clean-up as well as introduction of more interactive elements for more style + flare.

- 8/19/2021 - Added collapsable skill section that animates with "levels" of proficiency in various coding disciplines. Updated the look and feel, added some color and sectioning.

- 8/19/2021 (2) - Added contact form functionality. It is barebones and simply calls to mail:to instead of using PHP which is not supported by Github static pages.

- 8/23/2021 - Code clean up, fixes, site improvements.

- 8/24/2021 - Updates to Modal for better responsive display. QA/QC and deployment.
