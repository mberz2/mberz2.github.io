### Introduction

Welcome!

This repository/page serves a professional website and resume. Primarily this site will feature a variety of work and information related to the past few years of my studies at Portland State University majoring in Computer Science.

Below you will find a rough outline of what sections I will complete, as well as some meaningful updates.

### Updates

- 8/16/2021 - Used online guide: https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/blog/responsive-navbar-without-bootstrap/ for basis of a Fixed Navbar without Bootstrap.

- 8/17/2021 - Working on style/look/feel. Going with a single page design to be able to focus more on interactive elements, clean presentation, and JavaScript. Going with a retro-coder look (monospaced fonts, simple icons, etc).

- 8/18/2021 - Site setup mostly complete. Added first major interactive component outside the navbar, which consists of modal boxes that display information related to the resume. Going to work on code clean-up as well as introduction of more interactive elements for more style + flare.
