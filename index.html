          <h1>Hello and welcome to Homework 2!</h1>

          <h2>About me...</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Matthew Berzinskas, but I also go by Matt (pronouns: he,
            him, his). I'm a CS Undergrad Senior, finishing up the last few
            classes for my BS. I am originally from California, but moved to
            Oregon a couple years ago after leaving the Army to get my degree
            and be closer to friends and family that live in the area.
          </p>

          <p>
            After graduating, I hope to get a job in the cybersecurity
            industroy, which I feel is particularly relevant these days with all
            the various ransomware, hacks, and other incidents that seem to be
            in the news daily.
          </p>
          <p>
            When not in class, I like to spend time with friends and family,
            travel, explore the city, check out local food and drink spots, play
            video games, watch TV and movies, and a variety of other things.
          </p>

          <p>
            All five sections of the homework are viewable at the top of this
            page.
